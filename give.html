		<p>Thank you for supporting the Daily Bruin! Your donations allow us to provide vital resources to young journalists at UCLA, enriching the community through valuable reporting. Any and all support ultimately promotes the free press, helping us train students to be discerning, thoughtful and relentless in their reporting.
		</p>
		<p>Support will go directly into equipment, travel, training and scholarships – tangible things that make a huge difference in the Daily Bruin experiences of every staffer. You can always get in touch with the Daily Bruin alumni director to discuss details. Visit the “Contact” page for more information.

		<h3>UCLA Student Media</h3>
		<p>The Daily Bruin is part of UCLA Student Media, which is overseen by the <a href="http://uclacommunicationsboard.org/">UCLA Communications Board</a>. The Board is the independent
			publisher, manager and operator of the media organizations.
		</p>
		<p>All donations to the Daily Bruin or its sister media organizations are tax-deductible since UCLA Student Media is an
			independent, nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status.

			is 95-1777979.

		<p>Please visit <a href="https://donate.uclastudentmedia.com/">this website</a> to give directly to the Daily Bruin.

		<h3>UCLA</h3>
		<p>Because UCLA Student Media operates within Associated Students UCLA – a student-controlled, non-profit organization –
			donations <a href="http://giveto.ucla.edu/">to the university</a> can also be earmarked for the Daily Bruin’s operational costs.
		</p>

		<h3>Daily Bruin Alumni Association</h3>
		<p>We currently do not have mechanisms to fund the alumni group itself. We will update this page as our structure develops.
		</p>
		<hr class="major" />
		<h3>Other ways to help</h3>
		<p>There is a wealth of journalistic knowledge among Daily Bruin alumni. Please reach out to the DB alumni director if you’re interested in getting involved through workshops, critiques or other valuable journalistic services. We always appreciate such in-kind donations.
