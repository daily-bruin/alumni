		<h2>Volunteer</h2>
		<p>Thank you for your interest in joining our alumni committee! Alumni involvement is critical in our successful launch and we welcome your skills and help in building the infrastructure of our alumni network and in presenting the first-ever Daily Bruin Alumni Reunion on October 5, 2018 in Westwood.</p>
		<p>Here are the projects we are working on:</p>
		<h3>2018 Reunion and 2019 Centennial</h3>
		<p>From invitation logistics to coordination with the Daily Bruin alumni director, we are looking for help in staging our kickoff events. We are particularly interested in Los Angeles-based volunteers.</p>
		<h3>Alumni Network Development</h3>
		<p>Help us build the long-term components of the alumni group, including drafting bylaws and preparing for the election of the first board and officers. Subcommittees will work on developing specific program components, including mentorship, fundraising and the directory.</p>
		<p>Please send Tanner Walters an email at <a href="mailto:alumni@dailybruin.com">alumni@dailybruin.com</a> if you are interested in getting involved.</p>

		<h2>Daily Bruin Support Fund</h2>

		<h2>UCLA Student Media</h2>
		<p>The Daily Bruin is part of UCLA Student Media, which is overseen by the UCLA Communications Board. The Board is the independent publisher, manager and operator of the media organizations.</p>
		<p>All donations to the Daily Bruin or its sister media organizations are tax-deductible since UCLA Student Media is an independent, nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status. For your records, the federal taxpayer ID number for gifts to UCLA Student Media or any of its specific publications is 95-1777979.</p>
		<p>Please visit <a href="https://donate.uclastudentmedia.com/">this website</a> to give directly to the Daily Bruin.</p>
		<hr class="major" />
		<h2>Long-term Endowment</h2>
		<p>An endowment to supplement the Daily Bruin Support Fund would act as a means to help alleviate cuts The Bruin has undergone to its professional staff and operations. This would help provide academic scholarships for student journalists. Please contact Lawrence Ma (‘95) at <a href="mailto:lorenzoma@me.com">lorenzoma@me.com</a> with interest or questions.</p>
		<hr class="major" />
		<h2>Other Ways to Help</h2>
		<p>There is a wealth of journalistic and professional knowledge among Daily Bruin alumni. Please reach out to the DB alumni director if you’re interested in getting involved through workshops, critiques or other valuable journalistic services. We are committed to promoting news literacy on campus and in the greater Los Angeles community and always appreciate in-kind donations to help further that cause.</p>
