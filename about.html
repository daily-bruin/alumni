		<p>The Daily Bruin Alumni Association aims to actively engage with alumni of the Daily Bruin and support the longevity and advancement
			of the Daily Bruin. In addition to serving as a lasting community for the thousands of students who have served on the
			newspaper, the network will provide tangible support to aspiring student journalists at UCLA.
		</p>
		<p>This support will come through funding, mentorship and professional development programs, ensuring that The Bruin can
			continue providing important coverage in Westwood and its surrounding areas.
		</p>
		<p>The creation of this group comes a year after The Bruin created an editor position on staff to serve as the point person
			for all alumni activity and organization.
		</p>
		<p>Journalism is a valuable and necessary part of society, but there is great uncertainty in the media world. New challenges
			– technological, ideological or financial – require adaptation and careful consideration.
		</p>
		<p>A strong campus newspaper is vitally important, whether that is to hold local officials accountable, to teach young journalists
			the foundational basics or to instill news literacy in a community of readers.
		</p>
		<h3>The Vision</h3>
		<p>The alumni group is not just to aid the current staff. There are thousands of UCLA alums in the world. Some are in journalism,
			many are not. The Daily Bruin Alumni Network will help organize opportunities for those former staffers to reconnect
			– at reunions, meet-ups and through digital networks.
		</p>
		<p>Currently, in its initial stages, the group is acting as an organizing effort to reconnect The Bruin with its alumni. As the organization is formalized, we hope it will become more structured with a board that runs operations for the group. 
		</p>
		<p>One of the downfalls of past attempts to establish an alumni group has been the turnover that comes from a college organization. By creating infrastructure among alumni to run this association, longevity can be better achieved to support the Daily Bruin in perpetuity. The Daily Bruin alumni director and editor in chief would be key student representatives, but our aim is to make sure the responsibility does not fall upon them alone.
		</p>
		<p>Thank you for your patience and enthusiasm as we get these efforts off the ground!</p>

		<h3>Daily Bruin Hall of Fame</h3>
		<p>The Daily Bruin honored some of its distinguished graduates in the early 2000s with induction into the Daily Bruin Hall
			of Fame. The tradition came to end a few years later, but we have archives to find the initial inductees. We hope to
			revive the tradition or develop similar honors in the future.
