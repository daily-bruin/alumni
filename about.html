		<p>The Daily Bruin Alumni Network (the "DBAN") will actively engage the alumni of the Daily Bruin to serve as a robust community
			for all former staff members, in support of each other and The Bruin. The DBAN will provide funding, mentorship and professional
			development programs for aspiring student-journalists at UCLA, ensuring the excellence and longevity of The Bruin. The
			DBAN will encourage students to reach beyond UCLA, supporting community programs to advance news literacy and the free
			press.

		<h2>Program Components</h2>
		<h3>Alumni Engagement</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A governing board consisting of Daily Bruin alumni, the current student alumni relations director and current student editor
				in chief to oversee, manage and promote the DBAN.
			</li>
			<li>
				An annual on-campus general meeting and reunion, featuring speakers, career panels and receptions for Daily Bruin alumni
				from all professions, to strengthen bonds among each other and with the current students.
			</li>
			<li>
				A dedicated DBAN website, as well as active social media engagement, including private Facebook and LinkedIn groups, for
				our alumni in all professions to network, to reconnect, to promote our events and to share general updates and career
				opportunities.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Mentorship and Development</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Pro bono advisory workshops and newspaper critiques offered by alumni practicing journalists and media professionals for
				current Daily Bruin students and staff.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mentorship program and career guidance by alumni in journalism and related fields.
			</li>
			<li>
				Scholarship to fund original student journalism of global reach and impact.
			</li>
			<li>
				Work with academic departments like Communications Studies and English to bolster professional advising and develop journalism
				courses for student-journalists.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Community Engagement and Service</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The Daily Bruin News Literacy Project: With alumni funding and support, Daily Bruin advisors and staffers will regularly
				give back to the community by going to local middle schools and high schools to give workshops on the freedom of the
				press, journalism's role in democracy and general news literacy.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Alumni Funding/Endowment</h3>
		<p>The Daily Bruin has had to undergo significant changes in recent years due to steadily- declining advertising revenue.
			To maintain daily publication, The Bruin has had to seek funding from student fees in 2009 and 2016. To limit rent costs,
			the Kerckhoff Hall office was reduced to about half its previous size in 2017. The full-time student media advisor position
			was eliminated, and the rest of the professional staff has been reduced to just three positions. Editor stipends have
			fallen sharply, requiring many staff members to take additional jobs.</p>
		<p>The future of journalism depends on the continued success of college newspapers like the Daily Bruin, training the next
			generation of journalists and media professionals. Here are the ways the DBAN and its members can financially support
			the Daily Bruin:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The Daily Bruin Support Fund (#63255O): All alumni can earmark a portion or all of their annual UCLA giving to this official
				UCLA Office of Scholarships & Student Support Initiatives fund, created specifically to enhance the news-gathering and
				operational capabilities (such as equipment and travel) at the Daily Bruin.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Daily Bruin Alumni Scholarship & Endowment: Pitch and attract both high-dollar donations and regular alumni support,
				to establish an endowment to fund an alumni scholarship for student-journalists pursuing original reporting projects
				of global reach and impact, and to provide additional professional mentoring and advising to better position our student-staffers
				for the future job market in the media and related fields.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The Way Forward</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Spring & Summer 2018 - Recruit and assemble a founding alumni working group to set up the organizational structure and
				develop programs and benchmarks for the first 2-4 years. With the current Daily Bruin staff, this group would help plan
				and host the first general meeting and alumni reunion.</li>
			<li>Fall 2018 - The first annual general meeting and reunion of the Daily Bruin Alumni Network on Friday, October 5, 2018,
				in Westwood.</li>
			<li>The Centennial and Beyond: In 2019, the centennial of UCLA and the Daily Bruin, we will work toward gaining official UCLA
				Alumni Association recognition as an affinity alumni network and fully implement the above-stated goals and objectives.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Daily Bruin Hall of Fame</h3>
		<p>The Daily Bruin honored some of its distinguished graduates in the early 2000s with induction into the Daily Bruin Hall
			of Fame. The tradition came to end a few years later, but we have archives to find the initial inductees. We hope to
			revive the tradition or develop similar honors in the future.
