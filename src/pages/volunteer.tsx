      <p>
        Please help us build the infrastructure and the core programs of the
        Daily Bruin Alumni Network by becoming a team member of the Committee
        for DBAN! Our goal is to become an official UCLA Alumni Association
        affiliate network and a university-recognized support group for The
        Bruin, with robust networking, mentoring and fundraising capabilities,
        built to support fellow alumni and the Daily Bruin.
      </p>
      <h2>DBAN Project Teams</h2>
      <p>
        ALUMNI REUNIONS & EVENTS: Starting with our first reunion scheduled for
        October 5, 2018, DBAN will convene each fall for annual meetings and
        staff reunions. Other future events will include alumni panels for
        student staffers and regional Daily Bruin events in partnership with the
        UCLA Alumni Association.
      </p>
      <p>
        SCHOLARSHIPS & FUNDRAISING: This team will study the funding needs of
        The Bruin, implement fundraising strategies, and advise on the
        administration of the Daily Bruin Support Fund (#63355O), an official
        UCLA Foundation fund created to enhance the news-gathering capabilities
        of The Bruin and to build a scholarship for DB staffers doing journalism
        of global reach and impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALUMNI MENTORING PROGRAM: Due to declining revenue and budget cuts, a
        number of full time staff positions in support of The Bruin were
        eliminated over the past decade plus, including the full-time
        faculty-level advisor. This team will look into alumni mentorship
        programs, and new ways to provide Pro Bono advising and career
        development for the student-journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE BRUIN NEWS LITERACY PROJECT: A free and independent press is
        critical to a democracy. As a way of giving back to the community, we
        would like to encourage our student-journalists to engage the Los
        Angeles community and schools in teaching news literacy and the
        importance of the free press.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALUMNI DIRECTORY & NETWORKING: The DB alumni is an incredibly diverse
        and accomplished group thriving in business, the law, government,
        academia, tech, entertainment, and of course journalism. Become a class
        captain and help us bring our fellow alumni home and together.
